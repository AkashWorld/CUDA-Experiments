# CUDA-Experiments
## Parallel and Distributed Programming
This repository holds some of our experiments in parallelizing existing algorithms, and the issues that arise in terms of data allocation, synchronization, and verifying their correctness.

### Installing
Build instructions for the individual problems reside in the problem folders; please inspect the individual readme files. Write ups and analysis can be found in the individual folders as well.

### Contributions
Please create a subdirectory for the problem you are working on (ie. problem_2 directory for Problem 2) on a **separate branch**. Then once you are finished with the problem (tested, build instructions in readme.md, and writeup), submit a pull request.

## Current Allocations
Problem 1 - Ryan
Problem 2 - Khalid and Bhargav
Problem 3 - Suva and Jon
Problem 4 - Dan
Problem 5 - (Must be done by both groups) Brandon
